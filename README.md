5-stage-Pipelined-MIPS-Processor-
=================================

Built a 5-stage pipelined MIPS processor in Verilog. The MIPS processor was developed using the synthesizable subset of Verilog, and the processor executed C programs compiled using GNU GCC.   The input to the processor thus were the compiled SREC files which were parsed using a srec parser and fed into the processor.
